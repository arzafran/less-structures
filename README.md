# Three little structures

Based on the patterns described [here](http://modernweb.com/2014/04/14/organizing-your-css-code-for-preprocessors/), I've chosen three structures that looks better IMHO.

## Page Distribution
Suitable for medium to large-sized projects, uses a different stylesheet for every page.

## Design Terminology
Works best for designers, but is a good all-around solution for small to medium projects.

## [The Hugo Cocktail](http://www.sitepoint.com/architecture-sass-project/)
It may be an overkill for small projects, but you never know how big it's gonna get! if you stay positive you'd better be prepared.

## Preboot included
[Preboot](http://getpreboot.com/) is a comprehensive and flexible collection of LESS utilities, basic variables and mixins are ready to use, for more examples take a look at their documentation. 
Preboot is LESS based, but I've included [mustangostang's](https://github.com/mustangostang/preboot-sass) port, so it's available in both versions of this structures.
